			Many small business owners are managing their clients and their needs scattered between
			various tools. This makes it impossible to stay on top of all their client communications and
			results in details falling through the cracks. As their client list grows over time, they’re
			spending more time managing their client relationships than moving them forward.
		</p><p class="text-accent-blue mt-4 text-xl font-bold sm:mt-8 sm:text-2xl/8">
			There is a better way. Daylite CRM can help you regain control of your client relationships!
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
			Daylite CRM was made to help small businesses reduce the time it takes to keep track of client
			interactions and manage follow-ups. An app exclusively for your Mac, iPhone and iPad, that
			will organize client details, automate your routine tasks, manage your schedules, and free up
			your time so you can regain control and focus on doing what you love.
