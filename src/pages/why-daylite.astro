		<div class="container mx-auto space-y-4">
			<p class="font-semibold">We know how tough it can be running a small business.</p>
			<p>
				We used to own a technology consulting company. And like most small businesses, we worked
				hard—and sometimes failed—at keeping track of the professional relationships and commitments
				that drove our success. Trying to both code and nurture new business at the same time
				stretched us too thin. Things tended to slip through the cracks.
			</p>
			<p>
				We needed to streamline our work process, and find some solution that would help us get
				organized and thrive. But when we looked for software that would work on our Mac operating
				systems, we came up empty.
			</p>
			<p class="font-semibold">
				So like most software developers, we decided to build that tool ourselves!
			</p>
			<p>
				As it turned out, many other small businesses needed just the same thing. During a trip to
				MacWorld in 2002, an Apple employee encouraged us to sell our tool.
			</p>
			<p class="font-semibold">And that's how Daylite was born.</p>
			<p>
				Now, more than 20 years later, we remain more committed than ever to empower small
				organizations to dream big—by helping you simply get better doing what you do.
